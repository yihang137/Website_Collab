Project Overview
Our 3D modeling program aims to explore and apply digital modeling techniques to create high-quality 3D models.
The project combines key technologies such as modeling software, texture mapping, rendering and animation to provide customized solutions for different application scenarios. Whether it's game development or product design, our goal is to create detailed and creative 3D work.
Our 3D modeling projects aim to create high-quality 3D models using modern modeling techniques for applications in games, animation, architectural visualization and more. We use the professional software Blender for modeling
